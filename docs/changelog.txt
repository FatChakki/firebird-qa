.. currentmodule:: firebird.qa.plugin

Version 0.19.0
==============

* Switch from `setuptools` to `hatch`.
* Updated dependencies.

Version 0.18.0
==============

* Added cache for empty databases. This works transparently and does not require any
  special configuration. Databases are stored in `dbcache` subdirectory (created automatically)
  for combination of ODS + page size + SQL dialect + character set.

  Files in `dbcache` directory could be removed as needed (including whole directory)
  to fore creation of new database.

  Cache is enabled by default. Use new --disable-db-cache option to disable it.

Version 0.17.3
==============

* Added `--driver-config` option to specify different filename for driver configuration.

Version 0.17.2
==============

* Trace session support in plugin now uses service query with timeout (provided by
  firebird-driver 1.8.0) and terminates the trace thread gracefuly even if terminating
  trace session fails.

Version 0.17.1
==============

* When database initialization script fails, the XML output is extended with `dbinit-stderr`
  property that contains `stderr` output with errors reported by ISQL.

Version 0.17.0
==============

* Variable `test_cfg` renamed to `.QA_GLOBALS`.
* Added `.Mapping` and `.mapping_factory`.

Version 0.16.0
==============

* Added support for configuration of tests. A `~configparser.ConfigParser` instance is
  available as `test_cfg`. This instance is initialized with values from file `test_config.ini`
  located in `files` subdirectory.

Version 0.15.2
==============

* Fix problem with database init script. Now it uses the database charset instead default
  UTF8. The UTF8 is used only when database charset is not specified.

Version 0.15.1
==============

* Package `psutil` is now a dependency, installed automatically with plugin.
* Added `encryption` marker to mark test as requiring the encryption plugin

Version 0.15.0
==============

* To simplify portable use of databases with special configuration via `databases.conf`,
  the plugin initialization now ensures empty subdirectory `QA` in Firebird sample directory.
  To define your test databases in `databases.conf`, use next pattern::

    my_db = $(dir_sampleDB)/QA/my-db.fdb
    {
    ...
    }

  On plugin initialization, the `QA` sub-directory is first emptied and removed, and then
  newly created. On non-Windows, full privileges are granted.

* Added possibility to use databases aliases. The `.db_factory()` parameter `filename` is
  now handled as database alias if it starts with `#`, for example `#employee` means alias
  `employee`. The alias must be defined in `databases.conf` file.

  When filename is an alias, the `.Database.db_path` property does not contain
  full `~pathlib.Path` to the database, but this database alias.

Version 0.14.0
==============

* Added possibility to specify user, password and role in `.Action.connect_server()` and
  `.Action.trace()`

Version 0.13.1
==============

* Fixed problem with service encoding
* Fixed problem with tags in User

Version 0.13.0
==============

* Explicit `Optional` typing.
* Added support for both `encoding` and `encoding_errors` in `.Action.connect_server()`
  and `.Action.trace()`.

Version 0.12.1
==============

Initial release.
