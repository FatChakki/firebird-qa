TITLE:       ALTER TABLE - ALTER - TO
DESCRIPTION:
FBTEST:      functional.table.alter.05
    [12.07.2025] pzotov
    Removed 'SHOW' command.
    Check that one can *not* rename column if some restrictions exist for that, see:
    https://firebirdsql.org/file/documentation/html/en/refdocs/fblangref50/firebird-50-language-reference.html#fblangref50-ddl-tbl-altraltrto
    Statement 'ALTER TABLE...' followed by commit must allow further actions related to changed DDL.
    Separated expected output for FB major versions prior/since 6.x.
    No substitutions are used to suppress schema and quotes. Discussed with dimitr, 24.06.2025 12:39.
    Checked on 6.0.0.949; 5.0.3.1668; 4.0.6.3214; 3.0.13.33813.
