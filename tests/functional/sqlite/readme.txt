This directory is intended for storage tests from SQLite tracker and forum.
Most of them have to check only correctness of SQL queries result.
Some queries have no common sense but their syntax is valid.

Adaptation of tests to Firebird was done as much as possible with preserving
appropriate tickets ideas, but in some cases this was not feasible.
