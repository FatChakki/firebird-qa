TITLE:       READ CONSISTENCY. Check creation of new statement-level snapshot and restarting changed caused by UPDATE. Test-03.
DESCRIPTION:
  Initial article for reading:
      https://asktom.oracle.com/pls/asktom/f?p=100:11:::::P11_QUESTION_ID:11504247549852
      Note on terms which are used there: "BLOCKER", "LONG" and "FIRSTLAST" - their names are slightly changed here
      to: LOCKER-1, WORKER and LOCKER-2 respectively.

      **********************************************

      This test verifies that statement-level snapshot and restart will be performed when "main" session ("worker")
      performs UPDATE statement and is involved in update conflicts.
      ("When update conflict is detected <...> then engine <...> creates new statement-level snapshot and restart execution...")

      ::: NB :::
      This test uses script %FBT_REPO%/files/read-consist-sttm-restart-DDL.sql which contains common DDL for all other such tests.
      Particularly, it contains two TRIGGERS (TLOG_WANT and TLOG_DONE) which are used for logging of planned actions and actual
      results against table TEST. These triggers use AUTONOMOUS transactions in order to have ability to see results in any
      outcome of test.

      ###############
      Following scenario if executed here (see also: "doc/README.read_consistency.md"; hereafer is marked as "DOC"):

      * two rows are inserted into the table TEST, with IDs: 1,2
      * session 'locker-1' ("BLOCKER" in Tom Kyte's article ):
              update test set id=id where id = 2;

      * session 'worker' ("LONG" in TK article) has mission:
              update test set id = -id order by id; // using TIL = read committed read consistency

          // Execution will have PLAN ORDER <ASCENDING_INDEX>.
          // Worker starts with updating rows with ID = 1...2 but can not change row with ID = 2 because of locker-1.
          // Because of detecting update conflist, worker changes here its TIL to RC NO RECORD_VERSION.

      * session 'locker-2' ("FIRSTLAST" in TK article):
              (1) insert into test(id) values( 110);
              (2) insert into test(id) values(-11);
              (3) commit;
              (4) update test set id=-d where id = 110;
              (5) update test set id=-d where id = -11;

          // session-'worker' remains waiting at this point because row with ID = 2 is still occupied by by locker-1.
          // Records with (new) IDs = -11 and 110 will be seen further because worker's TIL was changed to RC NO RECORD_VERSION.

      * session 'locker-1':
              (1) commit;
              (2) insert into test(id) values(120);
              (3) insert into test(id) values(-12);
              (4) commit;
              (5) update test set id=-d where id = 120;
              (6) update test set id=-d where id = -12;

          // This: '(1) commit' - releases record with id = 2.
          // Because of TIL = RC NRV session-'worker' must see all committed records regardless on its own snapshot.
          // Thus worker sees records with id = -11 and 110 (which is locked now by locker-2) and puts write-lock on them.
          // [DOC]: "b) engine put write lock on conflicted record"
          // BECAUSE OF FACT THAT AT LEAST ONE ROW *WAS FOUND* - STATEMENT-LEVEL RESTART *NOT* YET OCCURS HERE.
          // [DOC]: "d) when there is *no more* records to fetch, engine start to undo all actions performed since
          //            top-level statement execution starts and preserve already taken write locks
          //         e) then engine restores transaction isolation mode as READ COMMITTED *READ CONSISTENCY*,
          //            creates new statement-level snapshot and restart execution of top-level statement."

      * session 'locker-2':
              (1) commit;
              (2) insert into test(id) values(130);
              (3) insert into test(id) values(-13);
              (4) commit;
              (5) update test set id=-d where id = 130;
              (6) update test set id=-d where id = -13;

          // This: '(1) commit' - releases records with IDs = -11 and 110.
          // Because of TIL = RC NRV session-'worker' must see all committed records regardless on its own snapshot.
          // Thus worker sees records with id = -12 and 120 (which is locked now by locker-1) and puts write-lock on them.
          // BECAUSE OF FACT THAT AT LEAST ONE ROW *WAS FOUND* - STATEMENT-LEVEL RESTART *NOT* YET OCCURS HERE.

      * session 'locker-1':
              (1) commit;
              (2) insert into test(id) values(140);
              (3) insert into test(id) values(-14);
              (4) commit;
              (5) update test set id=-d where id = 140;
              (6) update test set id=-d where id = -14;

          // This: '(1) commit' - releases records with IDs = -12 and 120.
          // Because of TIL = RC NRV session-'worker' must see all committed records regardless on its own snapshot.
          // Thus worker sees records with id = -13 and 130 (which is locked now by locker-2) and puts write-lock on them.
          // BECAUSE OF FACT THAT AT LEAST ONE ROW *WAS FOUND* - STATEMENT-LEVEL RESTART *NOT* YET OCCURS HERE.

      * session 'locker-2':
              (1) commit;

          // This releases records with id = -13 and 130.
          // Worker still waits for records with id = -14 and 140 which are occupied by locker-1.

      * session 'locker-1':
              (1) commit;

          // This releases records with id = -14 and 140.
          // At this point there are no more records to be locked (by worker) that meet cursor condition: worker did put
          // write locks on all rows that meet its cursor conditions.
          // BECAUSE OF FACT THAT NO MORE RECORDS FOUND TO BE LOCKED, WORKER DOES UNDO BUT KEEP LOCKS AND THEN
          // MAKES FIRST STATEMENT-LEVEL RESTART. This restart is also the last in this test.


      Expected result:
      * session-'worker' must update all rows.

      * Two unique values must be in the column TLOG_DONE.SNAP_NO for session-'worker' when it performed UPDATE statement: first of them
        was created by initial statement start and second reflects SINGLE restart (this column has values which are evaluated using
        rdb$get_context('SYSTEM', 'SNAPSHOT_NUMBER') -- see trigger TEST_AIUD).
        It is enough to count these values using COUNT(*) or enumarate them by DENSE_RANK() function.

      NOTE: concrete values of fields TRN, GLOBAL_CN and SNAP_NO in the TLOG_DONE can differ from one to another run!
      This is because of concurrent nature of connections that work against database. We must not assume that these values will be constant.

      Checked on 4.0.0.2195
      26.09.2020: added for-loop in order to check different target objects: TABLE ('test') and VIEW ('v_test'), see 'checked_mode'.
FBTEST:      functional.transactions.read_consist_sttm_restart_on_update_03
NOTES:
    [29.07.2022] pzotov
        Checked on 4.0.1.2692, 5.0.0.591
    [23.09.2023] pzotov
        Replaced verification method of worker attachment presense (which tries DML and waits for resource).
        This attachment is created by *asynchronously* launched ISQL thus using of time.sleep(1) is COMPLETELY wrong.
        Loop with query to mon$statements is used instead (we search for record which SQL_TEXT contains 'special tag', see variable SQL_TAG_THAT_WE_WAITING_FOR).
        Maximal duration of this loop is limited by variable 'MAX_WAIT_FOR_WORKER_START_MS'.
        Many thanks to Vlad for suggestions.

        Checked on WI-T6.0.0.48, WI-T5.0.0.1211, WI-V4.0.4.2988.
