ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/8498
TITLE:       Range-based FOR statement
DESCRIPTION:
    Test check issues from doc/sql.extensions/README.range_based_for.md:
        * ability to pass parameter for <variable>;
        * ability to use values near bounds for appropriate datatype and raised error;
        * error in case if non-exact numeric types are used for `<variable>`, `<initial value>`, `<final value>` and `<by value>`;
        * error if range-based FOR BY argument not positive (and not null);
        * caching of `<initial value>`, `<final value>` and `<by value>`
        * etc
    Basic test see in functional/gtcs/test_fb_sql_for_range.py
