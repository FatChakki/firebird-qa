ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/6915
TITLE:       Performance effect of applying 'DISABLE-COMPRESSIONS=1' in UNICODE collation for LOCALE=cs_CZ
DESCRIPTION:
    Test verifies only PERFORMANCE issues referred to in the ticket #6915. Correctness of ORDER BY is not checked.
    A pre-build database is used for check, see: files/gh_6915.zip (it was created in FB 4.x with date ~aug-2021).
    SQL script that was used to fulfill test DB see in the end of this file.
    We decompress .fbk, restore from it and check that for every testing queries number of indexed reads will not
    exceed threshold, see 'MAX_IDX_READS_THRESHOLD' (con.info.get_table_access_stats() is used for that).
    After improvement this threshold could be set to 1.
    Only columns with attribute 'DISABLE-COMPRESSIONS=1' are checked.
NOTES:
    [23.12.2024] pzotov

    It seems that commit in 4.x (2af9ded1a696a43f5b0bea39a88610287e3ab06c; 04-aug-2021 17:58) had no effect:
    performance in 4.x remains poort for queries from this test up to recent snapshots (dec-2024).

    Commit in 5.x (cfc09f75a3dea099f54c09808e39fe778457f441; 04-aug-2021 20:25) really SOLVED problem: adding
    attribute 'DISABLE-COMPRESSIONS=1' causes reducing indexed reads to 0 or 1 for all queries.

    There was commit in 5.x: 171cb7eebc365e301a7384eff96c0e3e069c95cc (date: 17-mar-2022 22:38) - which had
    further improvement for 'DISABLE-COMPRESSIONS=0' (i.e. when compression is Enabled). Snapshots of FB 5.x
    before that commit (i.e. up to 5.0.0.425) had poor performance for 'DISABLE-COMPRESSIONS=0', and after
    this commit (since 5.0.0.426) performance became equal to 'DISABLE-COMPRESSIONS=1'.
    Because of that, this test verifies performance of only ONE case: 'DISABLE-COMPRESSIONS=1', by comparing
    of indexed reads for each query with threshold, see MAX_IDX_READS_THRESHOLD.
    Before improvement related to 'DISABLE-COMPRESSIONS=1', indexed reads were huge for almost all check queries.
    This is outcome for 5.0.0.126 (31.07.2021):
        where f_ci_compr_disabled >= 'C' order by f_ci_compr_disabled rows 1            ==> idx reads: 352944
        where f_ci_compr_disabled >= 'Z' order by f_ci_compr_disabled rows 1            ==> idx reads: 1000000
        where f_ci_compr_disabled like 'C%' order by f_ci_compr_disabled rows 1         ==> idx reads: 352945
        where f_ci_compr_disabled like 'Z%' order by f_ci_compr_disabled rows 1         ==> idx reads: 1000000
        where f_ci_compr_disabled similar to 'C%' order by f_ci_compr_disabled rows 1   ==> idx reads: 352945
        where f_ci_compr_disabled similar to 'Z%' order by f_ci_compr_disabled rows 1   ==> idx reads: 1000000
        where f_ci_compr_disabled starting with 'C' order by f_ci_compr_disabled rows 1 ==> idx reads: 352945
        where f_ci_compr_disabled starting with 'Z' order by f_ci_compr_disabled rows 1 ==> idx reads: 1000000
        where f_cs_compr_disabled >= 'C' order by f_cs_compr_disabled rows 1            ==> idx reads: 1
        where f_cs_compr_disabled >= 'Z' order by f_cs_compr_disabled rows 1            ==> idx reads: 0
        where f_cs_compr_disabled like 'C%' order by f_cs_compr_disabled rows 1         ==> idx reads: 352945
        where f_cs_compr_disabled like 'Z%' order by f_cs_compr_disabled rows 1         ==> idx reads: 1000000
        where f_cs_compr_disabled similar to 'C%' order by f_cs_compr_disabled rows 1   ==> idx reads: 352945
        where f_cs_compr_disabled similar to 'Z%' order by f_cs_compr_disabled rows 1   ==> idx reads: 1000000
        where f_cs_compr_disabled starting with 'C' order by f_cs_compr_disabled rows 1 ==> idx reads: 352945
        where f_cs_compr_disabled starting with 'Z' order by f_cs_compr_disabled rows 1 ==> idx reads: 1000000

    Confirmed poor performance on 5.0.0.126 (31.07.2021): all check queries have huge indexed reads,
    regardless on 'DISABLE-COMPRESSIONS=1' attribute (i.e. it had no effect on performance), 
    execution time was 5...15 seconds for each query.
    Checked on 5.0.0.129 (05.08.2021 04:25) -- all OK, indexed reads for all queries are 0 or 1.
    Checked on 6.0.0.553, 5.0.2.1580.
