ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/pull/8434
TITLE:       Fix implicitly used collations after ALTER DOMAIN
DESCRIPTION:
    Test creates two tables ('test1' and 'test2'), both are used to check non-ascii characters; results for Natural and Indexed Reads are verified.
    First table is used to check output when 'common' indices are used, second - for check partial indices (and both tables have asc and desc indices).
    Every table has text field based on UTF8-domain, initially no collation is specified for it.
    Every table has four records with same character: 1) lowercased, with accent; 2) uppercased, with accent; 3) lowercased, "normal"; 4) uppercased, "normal".
    First table stores character 'd', second - character 'l'.
    We run query against each table with WHERE-expression like '<field> = <char>' -- where <char> is in lowercased, "normal" form (i.e. 'd' or 'l').

    When tables are in 'initial state' (i.e. before any domain altering) then such query must show only ONE record.
    Then we change domain definition three times:
    1) 'alter domain ... collate unicode_ci'.
        This must cause TWO records to be shown: 'lowercased, "normal"' and 'uppercased, "normal"'. Rows with accented chartacters must NOT be shown.
    2) 'alter domain ... collate unicode_ci_ai'.
        This must cause ALL records to be shown, i.e. in "normal" form and with accent.
    3) 'alter domain', i.e. WITHOUT any 'collate' mention.
        This must return output to what it was in 'initial state': only one record must be shown.
NOTES:
    [13.02.2025] pzotov
    ::: NB :::
    Currently only UTF8 charset is checked.
    We can NOT check single-byte character sets because some of them have incompleted definitions of ACCENT-/CASE- INSENSITIVE rules.

    For example, in src/intl/collations/pw1251cyrr.h we can see than 'e' with accent characters are defined as a standalone primary code,
    not with the same primary code as 'e' without accent.
    This causes different comparison result of characters used in French, Russian and Ukrainian alphabets, namely:
        1) 'e' vs 'é' vs 'É' // U+0065; U+00E9; U+00C9
        2) 'е' vs 'ё' vs 'Ё' // U+0435; U+0451; U+0401
        3) 'г' vs 'ґ' vs 'Ґ' // U+0433; U+0491; U+0490
    Result for "1" will be true in all cases for ISO8859_1, but result for "2" and "3" will be true only when we compare accent_lower vs accent_upper.

    Explained by Adriano, letter 13.02.2025 13:44.

    Checked on 6.0.0.336.
