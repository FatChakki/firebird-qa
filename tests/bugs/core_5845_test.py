ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/6106
TITLE:       ORDER BY on index can cause suboptimal index choices
DESCRIPTION:
JIRA:        CORE-5845
FBTEST:      bugs.core_5845
NOTES:
    [12.09.2023] pzotov
    1. Added several queries provided by dimitr.
    2. Plan for query "select ... where t.id1 = 1 and t.x > 0 and t.id2 = 0" - has been changed in intermediate snapshot
       5.0.0.1204 (timestamp: 20230912 08:00). One need to split expected results for FB 5.x+ and older versions.
       See:
           https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/commit/022f09287747dd05753bd11acd3b3fe4b0756f6e
           https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/compare/252c5b2b2f88...784f7bd8a6f5

    [25.06.2025] pzotov
    1. Re-implemented: use same Python dictionary which stores QUERIES as its KEYS and execution plans as values,
       depending on major FB version.
    2. ::: ACHTUNG :::
       We have to call <prepard_sttm_instance>.free() in order to prevent from pytest hanging after all tests completed.
       Workaround was provided by Vlad, letter 25.06.2025 13:36.
       See also explaination by Vlad: 26.10.24 17:42 ("oddities when use instances of selective statements").

    3. Separated expected output for FB major versions prior/since 6.x.
       No substitutions are used to suppress schema and quotes. Discussed with dimitr, 24.06.2025 12:39.

    Checked on 6.0.0.863; 6.0.3.1668; 4.0.6.3214; 3.0.13.33813.
