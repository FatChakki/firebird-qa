ISSUE:       5104
TITLE:       Regression: generators can be seen/modified by unprivileged users
DESCRIPTION:
  We create sequence ('g') and three users and one role.
  First user ('big_brother') is granted to use generator directly.
  Second user ('bill_junior') is gratned to use generator via ROLE ('stockmgr').
  Third user ('maverick') has no grants to use neither on role nor on generator.
  Then we try to change value of generator by call gen_id(g,1) by create apropriate
  connections (for each of these users).
  First and second users must have ability both to change generator and to see its
  values using command 'SHOW SEQUENCE'.
  Also, we do additional check for second user: try to connect WITHOUT specifying role
  and see/change sequence. Error must be in this case (SQLSTATE = 28000).
  Third user must NOT see neither value of generator nor to change it (SQLSTATE = 28000).
JIRA:        CORE-4806
FBTEST:      bugs.core_4806
NOTES:
    [18.08.2020] pzotov
    FB 4.x has incompatible behaviour with all previous versions since build 4.0.0.2131 (06-aug-2020):
    statement 'CREATE SEQUENCE <G>' will create generator with current value LESS FOR 1 then it was before.
    Thus, 'create sequence g;' followed by 'show sequence;' will output "current value: -1" (!!) rather than 0.
    See also CORE-6084 and its fix: https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/commit/23dc0c6297825b2e9006f4d5a2c488702091033d

    This is considered as *expected* and is noted in doc/README.incompatibilities.3to4.txt
    Because of this, it was decided to filter out concrete values that are produced in 'SHOW SEQUENCE' command.

    [15.05.2025] pzotov
    Removed 'show grants' because its output very 'fragile' and can often change in fresh FB versions.
