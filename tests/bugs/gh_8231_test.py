ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/8231
TITLE:       SubQueryConversion = true causes "request size limit exceeded" / "... unavailable resource. Unable to allocate memory ..."
DESCRIPTION:
NOTES:
    [26.08.2024] pzotov
    Two tables must be joined by columns which has different charset or collates.
    Confirmed bug on 5.0.2.1484-3cdfd38 (25.08.2024), got:
        Statement failed, SQLSTATE = HY000
        request size limit exceeded
    Checked on 5.0.2.1485-274af35 -- all ok.

    [18.01.2025] pzotov
    Resultset of cursor that executes using instance of selectable PreparedStatement must be stored
    in some variable in order to have ability close it EXPLICITLY (before PS will be freed).
    Otherwise access violation raises during Python GC and pytest hangs at final point (does not return control to OS).
    This occurs at least for: Python 3.11.2 / pytest: 7.4.4 / firebird.driver: 1.10.6 / Firebird.Qa: 0.19.3
    The reason of that was explained by Vlad, 26.10.24 17:42 ("oddities when use instances of selective statements").
    
    Thanks to dimitr for the advice on implementing the test.

    [16.04.2025] pzotov
    Re-implemented in order to check FB 5.x with set 'SubQueryConversion = true' and FB 6.x w/o any changes in its config.
    Checked on 6.0.0.687-730aa8f, 5.0.3.1647-8993a57
