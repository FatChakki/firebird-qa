ISSUE:       5349
TITLE:       CHAR_TO_UUID on column with index throws expression evaluation not supported. Human readable UUID argument for CHAR_TO_UUID must be of exact length 36
DESCRIPTION:
JIRA:        CORE-5062
NOTES:
    [18.01.2025] pzotov
    Resultset of cursor that executes using instance of selectable PreparedStatement must be stored
    in some variable in order to have ability close it EXPLICITLY (before PS will be freed).
    Otherwise access violation raises during Python GC and pytest hangs at final point (does not return control to OS).
    This occurs at least for: Python 3.11.2 / pytest: 7.4.4 / firebird.driver: 1.10.6 / Firebird.Qa: 0.19.3
    The reason of that was explained by Vlad, 26.10.24 17:42 ("oddities when use instances of selective statements").
