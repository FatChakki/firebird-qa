ISSUE:       7382
TITLE:       Performance improvement for BLOB copying
DESCRIPTION:
    We create TWO stored procedures.
    Both of them create blob ("b_src") with length = <N_BLOB_FINAL_LEN>.
    First procedure creates b_src in usual way: b_src = lpad('',n_len, 'a').
    Second procedure does this in loop with incrementing blob for one character, like this: b_src = blob_append(b_src, 'a').
    This means that in second SP blob will be created as STREAM (unlike it is in 1st proc).

    Then we make copy of this blob <N_COUNT_PER_MEASURE> times to another blob (in each SP).
    Duration of this SP execution is measured as difference between psutil.Process(fb_pid).cpu_times() counters.

    We do these measures <N_MEASURES> times for each SP, and each result is added to the list.
    Finally, we evaluate RATIO between duration of SP-1 and SP-2, and then obtain MEDIAN for that.
    This median must not exceed <MAX_RATIO> threshold.
    NB! It is desirable that test database will use page cache with big enough size
    (in order to avoid impact of blob creation on IO performance).
    Because of this, test DB will use info from predefined <REQUIRED_ALIAS> in the $QA_ROOT/files/qa-database.conf

    Before this improvement median ratio was 5.0 ... 6.0 (5.0.0.821). After this improvement (5.0.0.824) it is 1.25 ... 1.33.
    Values of median are equal on Windows and Linux, thus MAX_RATIO = 2 for both OS.

NOTES:
    [16.02.2023] pzotov
    1. One need to be sure that firebird.conf does NOT contain DatabaseAccess = None.
    2. Test uses pre-created databases.conf which has alias defined by variable REQUIRED_ALIAS.
       Database file for that alias must NOT exist in the QA_root/files/qa/ subdirectory: it will be created here.
       Content of databases.conf must be taken from $QA_ROOT/files/qa-databases.conf (one need to replace
       it before every test session).
       Discussed with pcisar, letters since 30-may-2022 13:48, subject:
       "new qa, core_4964_test.py: strange outcome when use... shutil.copy() // comparing to shutil.copy2()"
    3. Value of REQUIRED_ALIAS must be EXACTLY the same as alias specified in the pre-created databases.conf
       (for LINUX this equality is case-sensitive, even when aliases are compared!)

    [19.07.2023] pzotov
    Increased values of N_BLOB_FINAL_LEN and N_COUNT_PER_MEASURE, reduced value of N_MEASURES: every iteration must perform
    significant volume of job in order its "cpu_time().user" counter will be not too small. Discussed with Vlad.

    Checked on:
        LINUX Debian 10, FB 5.0.0.930 SS/CS
        Windows 8.1, FB 5.0.0.824 SS/CS
