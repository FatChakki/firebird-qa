ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/8252
TITLE:       Incorrect subquery unnesting with complex dependencies (SubQueryConversion = true)
DESCRIPTION:
NOTES:
    [14.09.2024] pzotov
    1. Parameter 'SubQueryConversion' currently presents only in FB 5.x and _NOT_ in FB 6.x.
       Because of that, testing version are limited only for 5.0.2. FB 6.x currently is NOT tested.
    2. Custom driver config object is created here for using 'SubQueryConversion = true'.
    3. Additional test was made for this issue: tests/functional/tabloid/test_aae2ae32.py

    [18.01.2025] pzotov
    Resultset of cursor that executes using instance of selectable PreparedStatement must be stored
    in some variable in order to have ability close it EXPLICITLY (before PS will be freed).
    Otherwise access violation raises during Python GC and pytest hangs at final point (does not return control to OS).
    This occurs at least for: Python 3.11.2 / pytest: 7.4.4 / firebird.driver: 1.10.6 / Firebird.Qa: 0.19.3
    The reason of that was explained by Vlad, 26.10.24 17:42 ("oddities when use instances of selective statements").

    Confirmed bug on 5.0.2.1497.
    Checked on 5.0.2.1499-5fa4ae6.

    [16.04.2025] pzotov
    Re-implemented in order to check FB 5.x with set 'SubQueryConversion = true' and FB 6.x w/o any changes in its config.
    Checked on 6.0.0.687-730aa8f, 5.0.3.1647-8993a57
