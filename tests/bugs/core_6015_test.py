ISSUE:       6265
TITLE:       Segfault when using expression index with complex expression
DESCRIPTION:
  Test creates following objects:
  * table <T> with two columnad, with adding rows;
  * stored proc <P>, which does update one record in the table <T> and returns changed value of column;
  * computed-by index on table <T> which evaluates result of stored proc <P>.

  Procedure can either use:
  1) static PSQL code for updating record, or
  2) change it using ES,
  3) change it using ES+EDS.

  Currently test checks cases "1" and "2" only.
  Check of case "3" if DEFERRED: ISQL will hang and, after it will be interrupted, Firebird process
  keeps database file opened infinitely because of alived EDS connect.
  Discussed with Vlad, letters 17.04.2021 09:52 and (reply from Vlad) 21.04.2021 10:40.

  ::: NB :::
  Code for FB 3.x is separated from 4.x because content of STDERR differs: FB 3.x raises 'lock-conflict'
  for static PSQL code (instead of "Attempt to evaluate index expression recursively").
  Also, error messages differ because CORE-5606 was not backported to FB 3.x.
JIRA:        CORE-6015
FBTEST:      bugs.core_6015
NOTES:
    [02.07.2025] pzotov
    Separated expected output for FB major versions prior/since 6.x.
    No substitutions are used to suppress schema and quotes. Discussed with dimitr, 24.06.2025 12:39.
    Checked on 6.0.0.889; 5.0.3.1668; 4.0.6.3214; 3.0.13.33813
