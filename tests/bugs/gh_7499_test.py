ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/7499
TITLE:       Problem with restore when backup has procedure which contains explicit PLAN clause with inappropriate indices.
DESCRIPTION: 
    Test uses .fbk which was created on the basis of DDL from gh_7517_test.py
    in FB 3.0.10.33665. There is stored procedure which has query that uses
    inappropriate index.
    Restore from this .fbk must finish with WARNING and display name of that index.
NOTES:
    [30.03.2023] pzotov
        Unfortunately, I could not find DDL that leads not only to warning (on FB builds after fix)
        but also to "gbak: ERROR" if we try to restore from this .fbk on FB builds *before* this
        problem was fixed: 'gbak -rep' on all major FB just silently finished w/o any message.
    [04.07.2025] pzotov
        Added 'SQL_SCHEMA_PREFIX' and variables - to be substituted in expected_* on FB 6.x
        Checked on 6.0.0.894; 5.0.3.1668; 4.0.6.3214.
