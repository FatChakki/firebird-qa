ISSUE:       1307
TITLE:       Garbage in plan output of complex statement
DESCRIPTION:
    This is unfortunate case. The fix for 2.1 went through several "adjustments" and we've
    get lost in changes. The result is that this was not properly fixed in 2.1 line (server
    doesn't crash, but don't returns the truncated plan as supposed either). Now when 2.1
    line is at 2.1.3 we can hope for proper fix in 2.1.4. It should work as intended in 2.5 line.
