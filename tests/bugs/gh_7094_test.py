ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/7094
TITLE:       Incorrect indexed lookup of strings when the last keys characters are part of collated contractions and there is multi-segment insensitive descending index
DESCRIPTION:
NOTES:
    [15.08.2023] pzotov
    Confirmed problem on 5.0.0.425.
    Checked on 5.0.0.1163, 4.0.4.2978.
    Test fails on 3.0.12 with 'invalid collation attribute', thus min_version was set to 4.0.2.
