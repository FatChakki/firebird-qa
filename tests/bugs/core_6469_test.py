ISSUE:       2376
TITLE:       Provide ability to see in the trace log actions related to session management (e.g. ALTER SESSION RESET)
DESCRIPTION:
  Test verifies management statements which are specified in doc/sql.extensions/README.management_statements_psql.md
  We launch trace session before ISQL and stop it after its finish.
  Every management statement is expected to be found in the trace log.

  ATTENTION: TWO SEPARATE BRANCHES present in this test for different OS.

  NOTES FOR WINDOWS
  #################
    Statement 'SET TRUSTED ROLE' is verified for appearance in the trace log.
    There are several prerequisites that must be met for check SET TRUSTED ROLE statement:
        * BOTH AuthServer and AuthClient parameters from firebird.conf contain 'Win_Sspi' as plugin, in any place;
        * current OS user has admin rights;
        * OS environment has *no* variables ISC_USER and ISC_PASSWORD (i.e. they must be UNSET);
        * Two mappings are created (both uses plugin win_sspi):
        ** from any user to user;
        ** from predefined_group domain_any_rid_admins to role <role_to_be_trusted>

    Connect to database should be done in form: CONNECT '<computername>:<our_database>' role <role_to_be_trusted>',
    and after this we can user 'SET TRUSTED ROLE' statement (see also: core_5887-trusted_role.fbt).

    ::: NOTE :::
    We have to remove OS-veriable 'ISC_USER' before any check of trusted role.
    This variable could be set by other .fbts which was performed before current within batch mode (i.e. when fbt_run is called from <rundaily>)

  NOTES FOR LINUX
  ###############
    Trusted role is not verified for this case.
    Weird behaviour detected when test was ran on FB 4.0.0.2377 SuperServer: if we run this test several times (e.g. in loop) then *all*
    statements related to session management can be missed in the trace - despite the fact that they *for sure* was performed successfully
    (this can be seen in ISQL log). It seems that fail somehow related to the duration of DELAY between subsequent runs: if delay more than ~30s
    then almost no fails. But if delay is small then test can fail for almost every run.
    NO such trouble in the Classic.
    The reason currently (03-mar-2021) remains unknown.
    Sent letter to Alex et al, 03-mar-2021.
NOTES:
[09.02.2022] pcisar
  Test fails on Windows as script execution fails with:
   Statement failed, SQLSTATE = 0P000
   Your attachment has no trusted role

[08.04.2022] pzotov
  [WINDOWS]
  1. The 'CONNECT ...' operator, being specified without USER/PASSWORD clauses, will take in account parameters that were specified in the command line
     of ISQL (confirmed by Alex, letter 03.04.2022 20:31).
     This means that it will use 'SYSDBA' / 'masterkey' rather than Windows trusted auth. This, in turn, leads that SYSDBA will be current user
     when following is performed:
         connect '{THIS_COMPUTER_NAME}:{act.db.db_path}' role tmp$r6469;
     - and it causes 'set trusted role' to fail (SQLSTATE = 0P000 / Your attachment has no trusted role).
     Because of this, we have to launch ISQL without using current credentials (which is True by default) - see 'credentials = False'.
  2. One need to run ISQL with requirement do NOT establish connection to the test database because this will be done in the test script itself.
     Otherwise we get 'Missing security context' *after* test finishes (the reason is unknown; instead, "Rolling back work." must be issued and redirected to STDERR).
     To prevent such error, we have to specify 'connect_db = False' in db_factory() call.

  Checked on 4.0.1 Release, 5.0.0.467.
