ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/8353
TITLE:       Report unique usernames for isc_info_user_names
DESCRIPTION:
    Test uses DbInfoCode.USER_NAMES property to obtain AGGREGATED info for every connected user (instead of getting list).
    This info looks like:
        <USERNAME> : <N_COUNT>
    - where:
        <USERNAME> = name of connected user
        <N_COUNT>  = number of attachments created by <USERNAME>, total for BOTH auth plugins: Srp + Legacy.

NOTES:
    [19.12.2024] pzotov
    Confirmed ticket issue on 6.0.0.552: N_COUNT > 1 are shown for both SYSDBA and non-dba users when they make more than one attachment.
    Checked on 6.0.0.553-7ebb66b, 5.0.2.1580-7961de2, 4.0.6.3172-4119f625: every user is specified only once, i.e. N_COUNT = 1
