ISSUE:       https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/8644
TITLE:       Connection error via Loopback provider if it's the first in the Providers parameter
DESCRIPTION:
    Test uses pre-created databases.conf which has alias (see variable REQUIRED_ALIAS) with Providers = Loopback,Remote,Engine14
    Database file for that alias must NOT exist in the QA_root/files/qa/ subdirectory: it will be created here.
NOTES:
    [26.06.2025] pzotov
    1. One need to be sure that firebird.conf does NOT contain DatabaseAccess = None.
    2. Value of REQUIRED_ALIAS must be EXACTLY the same as alias specified in the pre-created databases.conf
       (for LINUX this equality is case-sensitive, even when aliases are compared!)
    3. Content of databases.conf must be taken from $QA_ROOT/files/qa-databases.conf (one need to replace it before every test session).
       Discussed with pcisar, letters since 30-may-2022 13:48, subject:
       "new qa, core_4964_test.py: strange outcome when use... shutil.copy() // comparing to shutil.copy2()"
    4. ::: NB :::
       TEST CHECKS *ONLY* FB 6.x! Other major versions currently are not checked because of need to change 'NN' suffix in EngineNN value
       of Providers parameter ('NN' it must be '13' for 4.x and 5.x; '12' for 3.x).
       Despite the fact that 'Providers' property is mentioned in DPB class (see core.py), one can *not* to specify it in custom DB config
       because this property actually is not initialized anywhere in the source code of firebird-driver.
